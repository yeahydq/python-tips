# Question 16

### **Question:**

>***Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.***
>***Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:***

```
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
```

>***Then, the output should be:***

```
1,9,25,49,81
```

----------------------

### Hints:
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***

**Main author's Solution: Python 2**
```python
## The solution by the author is incorrect.Thus it's not included here.
```
----------------
**My Solution: Python 3**
```python
lst = [str(int(i)**2) for i in input().split(',') if int(i) % 2]
print(",".join(lst))
```

***There were a mistake in the the test case and the solution's whice were notified and fixed with the help of @dwedigital. My warm thanks to him.***

# Question 17

### **Question:**

>***Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:***
```
D 100
W 200
```
* D means deposit while W means withdrawal.

>***Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:***
```
D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100
```
>***Then, the output should be:***
```
500
```

**Main author's Solution: Python 2**
```python
import sys
netAmount = 0
while True:
    s = raw_input()
    if not s:
        break
    values = s.split(" ")
    operation = values[0]
    amount = int(values[1])
    if operation=="D":
        netAmount+=amount
    elif operation=="W":
        netAmount-=amount
    else:
        pass
print netAmount
```
----------------
**My Solution: Python 3**
```python
total = 0
while True:
    s = input().split()
    if not s:            # break if the string is empty
        break
    cm,num = map(str,s)    # two inputs are distributed in cm and num in string data type

    if cm=='D':
        total+=int(num)
    if cm=='W':
        total-=int(num)

print(total)
```

**Solution by: leonedott**
```python
lst = []
while True:
  x = input()
  if len(x)==0:
    break
  lst.append(x)

balance = 0
for item in lst:
  if 'D' in item:
    balance += int(item.strip('D '))
  if 'W' in item:
    balance -= int(item.strip('W '))
print(balance)
```
